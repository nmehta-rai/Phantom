# 👻 Phantom

**Phantom** is an AI-powered creative companion designed to help musicians (and eventually all artists) break through writer’s block, creative paralysis, and option overload — without ever giving them “the answer.”

It learns your style, echoes your past, and nudges you forward with poetic provocations and personalized constraints.

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🎨 Onboards artists with a creative profile (genres, influences, gear, skills, etc.)
- 📁 Lets you manage up to **two active projects** at a time — encouraging real follow-through
- 🌀 Offers **AI-generated nudges** to break creative blocks without taking control
- 🕯️ Builds a memory of your thoughts over time (Echoes) to inspire future prompts
- 🔮 Will expand to support all art forms (photography, painting, writing, etc.)
